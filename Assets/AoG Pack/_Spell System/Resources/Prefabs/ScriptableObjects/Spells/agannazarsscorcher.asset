  description: Upon casting this spell, a jet of flame appears at the caster's fingertips
    and bursts out toward one target of the caster's choice. That target will be
    hit by this flame for 3d6 points of damage. The flame jet strikes a second time
    halfway through its duration, and the caster may move while the spell is in effect.
    There is no Saving Throw against this spell, though anti-fire capabilities such
    as Fire Resistance will apply and may reduce or eliminate the damage.
